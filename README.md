# TWON: Threads - A Generative Agent Demo

The repository contains an interactive demo to showcase the behavior of generative agents in a social media thread. The agents are powered by large language models inferenced through APIs (Hugging Face, OpenAi). Further, users can customize the prompt-based interaction or add custom agents for their discourses.

Note: Currently, the work is an alpha version and will undergo breaking changes during the development.
